# QuestLog


QuestLog is a platform built for gamers to track, organize, and share their progress across multiple video games. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, it allows players to maintain a personal gaming journal that includes detailed statistics, personalized notes, individual ratings, and other meaningful insights. QuestLog creates a centralized and intuitive space where players can reflect on their achievements, monitor their overall journey, and stay connected to the games they love.
